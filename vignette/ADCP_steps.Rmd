# Introduction

This vignette discusses the steps to convert a moored acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) ODF file to a NetCDF file. To convert a list of ADCP ODF files, use the suggested work flow provided below. The data used in this study is from the Davis Strait.

# Get necessary data

To get the necessary data, use the `getData()` function. This function gets the available standard names, units, codes,names, and type of data for the required information for the specified instrument type.



# Compile one adp object from multiple ODF files

To compile one adp object from multiple ODF files, use the `compileOdfToAdcp()` function. This function reads in a set of odf files and compiles into adp object. It is capable of recognizing missing bins or missing odf files and inserting NA values in appropriate slot of data variables

# Create a single NetCDF

To create a single NetCDF, use the `singleAdpNetCDF()` function. This function exports an adp object to a NetCDF using variables and metadata
within adp combined.There are a number of steps that go into this including:

1. Setting dimensions
2. Defining variables
3. Writting definitions to the NetCDF file using nc_create()
4. Insert variables into the NetCDF file using ncvar_put()
5. Writing data into existing NetCDF using ncatt_put()

# Work flow

A typical work flow is as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(odfToNetCDF)
library(oce)
data <- getData(type="adcp")
files <- list.files(pattern="ODF")
adp <- compileOdfToAdp(files)
singleAdpNetCDF(adp, name="test", debug=1, data=data)
```

# Caution

It should be noted that for code PGDP (percent good pings), TE90 (Temperature (1990 scale)), and DEPH (Sensor Depth below Sea Surface) there were no CF standards. Their standard names have been entered as percent_good_pings, temperature_1990_scale, and sensor_depth_below_sea_surface respectively.

Additionally, codes CMAG and HEAD were not identified in the list of DFO codes (Government of Canada, 2022), but were given standard names of current_magnitude and heading respectively.
